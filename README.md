## What I'm about 🚀

I'm that dev who gets way too excited about clean code and probably has more browser tabs open than is socially acceptable. Currently vibing in the world of [MERN] and always down to learn something new that'll blow my mind 🤯

```javascript
const me = {
  pronouns: "he/him",
  location: "Brazil",
  currentlyLearning: ["Spring Boot"],
  askMeAbout: ["That project I'm weirdly passionate about"],
  funFact: "I debug with console.log and I'm not sorry 🤷‍♀️"
};
```

## Tech Stack That Makes Me Happy 💫

**Languages I Actually Know:**
- JavaScript
- TypeScript (JavaScript but make it fancy)
- Java

**Frameworks & Tools:**
- React
- Node.js 
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- Docker

**Currently Exploring:**
- Spring Boot
- AI/ML

## Projects I'm Actually Proud Of 🎯

- Built with: [React, TailwindCSS, Vite]
- What it is: [It's an interactive travel promotion website]

## Let's Connect! 🤝

I'm always down to chat about code, life, or why tabs vs spaces is still a debate in 2024...
